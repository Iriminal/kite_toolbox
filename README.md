# The Project kite toolbox
A toolbox for simple video and audio encoding. Written in C#. Licensed under GPL.

一个简单的视频和音频编码器. 使用C#编写. 遵守 GPL 开放源代码协议.
## 为什么要开发此工具 Why this software has been developed:
Almost of these commercial products are too complicated , overloaded and professinal. And even expensive.
They always follows **'users are all expert'** to make software. But actually, most user do not know how to do when they see the software. Once a person uses the software, he even do not know what arguments should he use best.
These tools also open a 'teaching material' market, just because when a person want to use the tool, he needs to learn it first.
So we decided to make kite toolbox. Just for simpler user experience.
When we develop, we make a "flat" experience. Concise but not simple.


大多数市面上的此类工具都过于繁杂和"专业", 甚至很昂贵. 他们总是遵循**用户都是专家**的理论来开发软件。但是, 事实上大部分用户看到这些软件后都会不知所措~~被水淹没~~. 当一个人使用此类软件时, 甚至不知道最好的参数应该是什么.
这些软件还打开了教材书籍的市场, 因为当一个人想要用某个工具时, 他还需要进行学习.
所以, 我们决定开发 kite toolbox 来简化用户体验.
为用户做"扁平"的体验. 使它简约, 而背后并不简单.


Under construction, Please keep watching.

开发中, 敬请期待 kite toolbox.
